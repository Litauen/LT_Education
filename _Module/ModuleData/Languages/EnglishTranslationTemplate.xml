    <string id="LTE00305" text="Eadric is a middle-aged book vendor who hails from the Empire but pretends to be from the North. Short in height and always wearing monk clothes, he speaks in a pleasant voice and is incredibly polite. However, Eadric is also mysterious, always careful and cautious, as if hiding from someone.

Despite this, he is known for his vast knowledge of literature and his impeccable customer service."/>

Her father, a former soldier, taught her how to fight, while her mother instilled in her a passion for literature. She travels and sells books, using her skills to protect herself along the way. Despite her tough exterior, Ingeborg has a kind heart and is known for her extensive knowledge of literature."/>
    <string id="LTE00307" text="Ahsan, an old man from a southern village, was always known for his hot temper. Despite his abrasive personality, he had a deep love of books, becoming a respected book vendor. As he grew older, Ahsan became increasingly isolated, retreating into his books as a shield against the world. Despite his grumpiness, he was revered for his knowledge and dedication to literature."/>
